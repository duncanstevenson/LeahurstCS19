This program comes with simulated examples of Python program execution on a PC.
#explanation#
To help you learn key ideas and skills in Python and computer science in general, this course has a built-in code simulator. In the table of contents, any part of a section labeled 'Example' will be a code example displayed with the help of the simulator.

To use the simulator, you just need to click through the program source code using the spinbox indicated in the figure on the left. Doing so will: [a] change the color of the source code (the line about to be executed is labeled as green); [b] update the symbol table after each line has been executed; [c] update the screen output after each line has been executed; [d] leave a note for you to read in the NOTES section. The notes will help you understand what is happening. Let's try out first simulated example on the next page!
