Objects can be a variable, function, method or a data structure.
#explanation#
Functions are objects but objects are not always functions.
An analogy that we can use is:
If a car is our object then its properties (in computer science called fields/attributes) would be its colour, speed, model, etc. And its actions (called methods in computer science) can be turning headlights on and off, turning, speeding up and slowing down, etc.

In the image on the left, you can see the two examples of objects, the first is the variable x, and the second is the car we previously mentioned.
