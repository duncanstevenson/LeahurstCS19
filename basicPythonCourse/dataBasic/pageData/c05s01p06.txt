The find() method lets you find charachters or smaller strings inside of larger ones.
#explanation#
The find method is very usefull if you need to analyse the contents of a string. Sometimes you will want to check if someone uses a letter "I" in some text or a response, or maybe you want to be able to allow people to tell you more than they need in an input, with the program still understanding they said "Yes". Or you want to replace every "Yes" in some text with the word "No". To do this you need to know were in the text those smaller strings appear. This is what the find method is for. To use the find method, you have to provide it the string that you are looking for in the larger string as an argument. Remember that the method only returns the index of the first occurence of the smaller string, not all of the times it shows up. If the string does not show up, it will return -1.
