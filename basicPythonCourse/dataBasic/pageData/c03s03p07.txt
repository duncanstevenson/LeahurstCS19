There are six different ways to perform a comparison operation.
#explanation#
Comparisons are VERY useful in computer science. We will do them often. Until we learn WHY they are important, we need to understand HOW they work.

The table on the left summarizes the six comparison operators. The first, called the equality operator, checks if two values are equivalent. For example, 1==1 would return True, whereas 1==2 would return False. Be careful not to confuse equality comparison (==) with assignment (=). Equality comparison always involves two equal signs, whereas assignment involves only one. Also, make sure you understand the difference between equality comparison (==) and inequality comparison (!=). They basically have the opposite functionality.

Make sure you understand all six operators before moving on.
