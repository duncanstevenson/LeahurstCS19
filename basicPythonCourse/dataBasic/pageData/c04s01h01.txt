[K2] What is the difference between an if statement and an if-else statement?
[K3] What is the difference between an if-else statement and an if-elif-else statement?

#TI#h8
[T1] Write the three modified versions of the dog year converter program with special messages that depend on user input. The first program should use an if-statement, the second should use an if-else, and the third should use an if-elif-else statement.
[T2] Write a program that asks the user to type in how they are feeling. If the length of their answer is less than 200 characters, write them a reassuring message. If their answer is longer than 200 characters, let them know you'll need time to process their response and will get back to them later.
[T3] Write a program that asks the user for input. Think of a way that you can analyze their input to respond in seven different ways. Test your program to make sure it is possible for all seven outcomes to occur.
#A#h1.5
[A1] Analyze the three examples found at the end of this section. Notice notes weren't given this time. By clicking through the simulator one-step at a time, write your own note about what you think is happening each important step of the way. After you finish the first example, discuss it with the teacher before continuing.
