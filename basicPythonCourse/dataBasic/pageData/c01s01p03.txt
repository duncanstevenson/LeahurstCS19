Computer data is nothing but 0's and 1's stored in computer memory.
#explanation#
The data stored inside a computer can be processed into very complex and rich information despite being binary (made up of only two values).

Modern computer memory is capable of holding trillions of 0's and 1's in a very small chip called RAM. The microscopic container that can hold a single 0 or 1 is called a bit. The computer can change or access the value of any given bit upon command. A programmer achieves this by taking advantage of a fancy address book we will learn about later. 

The task of a computer's brain (called the central processing unit or CPU) is to convert sequences of binary data stored in memory into meaningful information. Let's learn a few different ways that binary data can represent information.
