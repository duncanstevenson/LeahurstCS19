Booleans and Intergers are Objects too.
#explanation#
Booleans and intergers are objects, just like the "car" object you saw in previous lessons, But Intergers and Booleans are a bit special. They are special because they have only one field (the value you assign it) and no methods you can use to change them. They are technically still objects though, as they have a value and point to an address in ram, but they are different from most objects because they only carry one piece of information and nothing else. 
Intergers and Booleans can be manipulated using operators, just like other objects, but have no other functionality. Most of the time we don't need to think about Booleans and Intergers as objects, but it may be usefull for understanding why you can create a variable as an interger, then change it to a string later in the program.
