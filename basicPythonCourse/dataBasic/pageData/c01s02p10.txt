Strings are entered in Python as text in between quotation marks.
#explanation#
Strings can be defined in Python in two ways: using single quotes OR double quotes (but not both). If you define a string using double quotes, single quotes can be used within the string itself (and vice versa). You can force a string to jump to the next line using the escape character '\n'.

Numbers defined inside strings are not treated as numbers, instead, they are treated as characters. Notice in the example shown what happens when the + symbol and the * symbol are used on strings containing numbers. The + symbol joins the strings together, and so, '1'+'2' = '12' (not '3'). The * symbol repeats a given string, so '12'*3 = '121212', not '36'.

Make sure you understand all the lines of code in the example shown before continuing.
