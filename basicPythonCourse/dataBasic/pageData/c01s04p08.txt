Here is the program you will write for your first mini project.
#explanation#
You're now ready to write your first program that actually does something.

First, create a folder in your FORAS folder called Projects. Next in Sublime Text, create a new file called unitConversion.py and save this file in your Projects folder.

Your goal is to write code that converts a speed in kilometers per hour into meters per second. At the beginning of the program, define a variable called speed and set it to some value. Next, figure out the math that converts this speed to meters per second.
