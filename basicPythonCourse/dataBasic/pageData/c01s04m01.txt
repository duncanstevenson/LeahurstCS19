Write your first interesting program from scratch! 

Your program should be written using the Sublime Text Editor and run from the command line. Ask your teacher for help in setting up a good workflow if you are still a bit confused. After asking enough times, you'll be able to do it on your own, so don't be shy!

The goal of your program is to define a number in a variable called speed. Then, perform a math operation on speed and store the result of this operation in a new variable called something of your choice. Then, using a series of print statements, make the output similar to that shown in the previous page.
