This is the last time I'll tell you what to do on line 01 of a program. From now on, you may see empty boxes in the notes section. If this is the case, click through anyways, and notes will appear when I want to draw your attention to something. Otherwise, it's your job to make sense of the results. Ask the teacher questions if you need to!

Click down to start moving through the program.
#n#2
The string 'hello there' is assigned to the variable x. The user will not see this happen.
#n#3
The string "say it ain't so" is assigned to the variable y. The user will not see this happen.
#n#4
The string "you're quite welcome" is assigned to the variable z. The user will not see this happen.
#n#5
The value stored in the RAM address that z is pointing to is printed to the screen. Thus, the user sees only the text "you're quite welcome".

Notice that even though z was printed, the symbol name is not printed when this happens. The user will have no idea that the symbol names x, y, or z were even part of the program!
