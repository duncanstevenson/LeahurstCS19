An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators and functions.
#explanation#
As programmers, we need the flexibility to do many different operations, in different combinations. Thus, we must learn the next important concept; that is, the idea of an expression. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions; however, not all of those ingredients need be in ALL expressions. In fact, an expression can be as simple as a single-value, a single-operation, a single function call, or a single variable. 

In the example shown, the expression involves all four possible ingredients. If s is a variable holding the string "Hi", can you deduce what the value of the entire expression must be?

This question motivates the next lesson.. that is, the return value of an expression. Turn the page.
