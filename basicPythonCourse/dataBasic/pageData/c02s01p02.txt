Functions are given names by programmers to make executing several computations easier.
#explanation#
Functions are written to have a specific purpose; that is, to achieve a specific programming goal. 

Functions perform a series of computations. In the example shown, the function named foo performs computations 1-6. Functions are convenient because we only have to specify what the computations are once. After we have defined a function and its computations, from that point onwards we simply have to refer to the FUNCTION NAME whenever we want the computations to occur.

To make an analogy, think of the word 'jump'. If I ask you to jump, you first have to bend your knees and then thrust yourselves upwards; two steps are involved and yet I can use a single command (jump) to make both steps occur. It's the same idea for functions.
