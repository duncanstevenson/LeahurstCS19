A method is a function that is specific to an object. A Field a value can be accessed by dot-notation.
#explanation#
A method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent). Methods are also called differently than functions. When using methods/calling them, python requires programmers to use dot notation as shown in1 the image on the left, line 5. In the example on the left, we have assigned the variable x to the string value "Hello". And then we assigned y to equal the same value of x, but with all the characters capitalized. So when we print y, it will appear as "HELLO".

In conclusion, both methods and fields require dot notation, and are different from each other: a method is a function of an object, and a field is a value of it.
