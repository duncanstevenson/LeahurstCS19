A method is a function that is specific to an object. A Field a value can be accessed by dot-notation.
#explanation#
Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object( dependent). method has a different way you call in a function. while you define a function, like in line 1, you need a "def" + function name +parameter(s). While defining a method, python uses a dot-notation like mentioned in lesson 2, shown as line 6 and 10, applied fields "append" and "upper".
Python has some list methods that will make programmer coding with ease. For example: if you want to add something to a list, you can use "List.append()". or inserting element to the list using "list.insert()".
according to programm shown on image, it's clear that methods and field can be both accessed while method is a funtion to an object and field is a value of it.
