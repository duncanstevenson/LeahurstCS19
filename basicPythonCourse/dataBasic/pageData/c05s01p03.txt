A method is a function that is specific to an object. A Field a value can be accessed by dot-notation.
#explanation#
Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object( dependent). method has a different way you call in a function. while you define a function, like in line 1, you need a "def" + function name +parameter(s). While defining a method, python uses a dot-notation like mentioned in section 2, shown as line 5 , applied fields "upper" to capitalize the word.


according to programm shown on image, it's clear that methods and field can be both accessed while method is a funtion to an object and field is a value of it.
