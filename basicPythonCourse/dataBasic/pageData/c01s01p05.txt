Integers are positive or negative whole numbers.
#explanation#
Last lesson mentioned that a bit is not always interpreted as boolean. In fact, usually, bits are not analyzed in isolation, but rather, they are grouped together into units before interpretation.

Integers can be represented by units of bits using several conventions. The simplest to understand is called the signed magnitude representation (SMR). In 4-bit SMR, the most significant bit of the unit (shown as blue) keeps track of the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative) whereas the other three bits keep track of the magnitude (shown in red).

How do we get the magnitude? By simple counting! 000=0, 001=1, 010=2, 011=3, 100=4,101=5, 110=6, and 111=7. To store larger integers than 7 (or -7) we need more than 4 bits in the unit.
