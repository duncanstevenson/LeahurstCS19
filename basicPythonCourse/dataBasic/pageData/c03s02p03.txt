Characters in strings can be extracted using the slice operator.
#explanation#
Often we want to do something a little more fancy with strings: we want to chop them up and use only some of the characters within them. This can be achieved using an operator called the slice operator. 

Strings are just arrays of characters. For example, the string 'hello world' is just an array of 11 characters 'h'+'e'+'l'+'l'+'o'+' '+'w'+'o'+'r'+'l'+'d'. Each character in a string is assigned an INDEX. The first index is always 0. So, in 'hello world', the character at index 0 is 'h' and the character at index 10 is 'd'. When we want to access a single character of a string, we slice it using square brackets and an integer representing the index we are interested in. So, 'dud'[0] returns 'd', whereas 'dud'[1] returns 'u'. In the example shown, how can we slice the last letter?
