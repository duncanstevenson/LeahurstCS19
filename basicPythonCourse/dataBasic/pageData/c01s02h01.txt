#TI#h6.5
[T1] In IDLE, print the string '412412412412' using a string containing only 3 characters.
[T2] In IDLE, print a simple picture using only one print statement, taking advantage of escape characters. For example, to see what I mean, copy and paste in IDLE:    print("* *\n o \n _ ")
[T3] Repeat T2 and make a different picture.
[T4] What happens if you concatenate the two strings you made in T2 and T3 together, and then print? Ie. make a command such as print("pic1string"+"pic2string")
#A#h1.5
