Position your windows for efficient coding and program execution.
#explanation#
When you are working with a text-editor, you want to have quick access to the text-editor (Sublime) and the window running the program (CMD or Terminal).

I suggest you have half your screen dedicated to coding, and the other half dedicated to CMD or terminal. This will make the coding process less cumbersome.

It may also be a good idea to have IDLE and the course minimized so you can open up either very quickly for a mini experiment or a quick reference.
