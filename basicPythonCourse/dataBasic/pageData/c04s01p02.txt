A condition is an expression that returns a boolean value.
#explanation#
The first step in making a decision within a computer program is by creating something called a condition. A condition is simply an expression that returns a boolean value. We already learned last chapter how to interpret such expressions. 

For example, take a peek at the image on the left. Here a condition has been defined: x>y. This is an expression that contains two variables (x and y) and a comparison operator (>). When the value stored in x is greater than the value stored in y, the expression returns True. When the value stored in x is less than or equal to the value stored in y, the expression returns False. 

The reason this is called a 'condition' is because it can serve as the criteria for making a decision.  Let's learn how.
