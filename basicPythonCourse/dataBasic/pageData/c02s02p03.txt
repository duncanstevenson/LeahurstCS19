The return value of the input() function is always a string.
#explanation#
Sometimes, as a programmer, you will want the user to define something as a string, and at other times, you will want them to define something as a number. 

The input function, regardless of your programming goal, will ALWAYS return the input of the user as a string. In the example shown, the user -- after being prompted for their age -- typed in 17 and pressed enter. Python will return a value of "17" (a string) from the function and store it in the variable age.

Thus, if the programmer wants to interpret age as an integer, they must add extra code to convert age from <class 'str'> to <class 'int'>. This is not a complicated thing to do, but it often a reason for bugs appearing in a program.
