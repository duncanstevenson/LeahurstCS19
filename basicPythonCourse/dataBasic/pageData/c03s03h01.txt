[T1] Click back to lesson "Boolean Expressions with not, or, and". What would the three example expressions return if the precedence rule was reversed? (ie. if or had highest and not had lowest).
[T2] In IDLE experiment with all 9 operators studied in this section and make sure you understand how they work with concrete examples. Report at least two concrete examples tested in IDLE per operator.
