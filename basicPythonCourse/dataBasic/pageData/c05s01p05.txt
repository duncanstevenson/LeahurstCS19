A for-loop obeys strict syntax rules.
#explanation#
A for loop has a very similar syntax to a while-loop. Instead of while-statement, there is a for-statement (using the keyword 'for'). There is a colon (as usual) at the end of the for-statement. The code-block is indented using consistent indentation. However, there is NO CONDITION in a for-loop. Instead, a for-loop works by predefining a set of values to loop over. 

On the left, on line 2, the for-statement defines a variable i that should take on values in the range 0-9 (each time incrementing by 1). When the range() function is used with a single argument, it is assumed that the range will start at 0 and end at a value one less than the argument value. If two arguments are used instead (see line 9), variable i will take on values starting at 4 and ending at 11. Can you figure out why i takes on values 5,8,11,14 when the for-statement on line 16 is used?
